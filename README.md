# Fidum Stats :compass:

Fidum is a (*full*) online statistical software that tries to simplify and **democratize** simple or complex tools, algorithms and techniques. You can try the last version [here](https://fidum.io) which includes some common statistical tools such as:

- Descriptive statistics
- Visualization
- Clustering and classification algorithms

## Why another statistics software?

Although there exist several other tools, the goal of Fidum is to be a simple (free and open source), yet comprehensive source for statistical analysis

## Why is there a compass in the title?

I like to think that you should try your best to guide your decisions with data as much as you can, statistics is kind of a compass (:compass:) in the (:world_map:) world of data. Without it you may get to your goal, with it you can be confident that eventually you'll get there... Ok, maybe it is just a nice icon to use on the page    

## Why don't you add more functionalities?

I try as hard as I can, I love this project, but it is hard as hell so it is still a WIP
